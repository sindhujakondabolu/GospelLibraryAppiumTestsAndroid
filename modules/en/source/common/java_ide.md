## Java IDE

Java has a number of popular editors. For this module,
we'll be using `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition`, an open source IDE by
JetBrains. The software is available [for free download at this link](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

If you already have a preferred editor, feel free to continue using it. The
sample projects use Maven and work with Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ.
