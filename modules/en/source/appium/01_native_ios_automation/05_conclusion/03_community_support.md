## Community Support

Appium has community support in the form of a
[Google discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/appium-discuss).

Make sure to read through the
[online documentation](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md)
before posting a question. In addition to the documentation, make sure to search
the group archive to see if your question has already been asked.

You may want to review [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
if you're new to online discussion groups.
