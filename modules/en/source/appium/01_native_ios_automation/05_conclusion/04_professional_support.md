## Professional Support

Sauce Labs offers professional support for appium on their hosted cloud. If
you are a Sauce Labs customer and encounter an issue on the Sauce platform,
then make sure to open a support ticket.

Apple supports UI Automation so if there are bugs in the Apple software that
reproduce without using appium,
[file them with apple](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/). As Apple
keeps all bugs private, it's helpful to also duplicate the report to
[open radar](http://openradar.appspot.com/).
