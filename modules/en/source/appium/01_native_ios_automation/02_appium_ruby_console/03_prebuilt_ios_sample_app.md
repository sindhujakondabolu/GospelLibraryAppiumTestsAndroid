## Prebuilt iOS Sample App

To make it easier to get started, I've uploaded a prebuilt version of the
iOS sample app. If for some reason this app doesn't work on your system, you
may need to build from source. Instructions for building the sample app from
source are in the previous lesson.

UICatalog.app is available [as a zip](https://github.com/appium/ruby_lib/raw/master/ruby_lib_ios/UICatalog.app.zip). I
recommend unzipping the app before using it with appium.
