Appium relies on uiautomator for Android automation. Selendroid is also
supported for Android and is particularly useful for older devices and
webview support. While a deep understanding of these frameworks is not
required, it's helpful when determining what's possible with appium.

Google has posted the session videos from GTAC 2013. There are a
number of excellent sessions related to user interface automation.
