## Professional Support

Sauce Labs offers professional support for appium on their hosted cloud. If
you are a Sauce Labs customer and encounter an issue on the Sauce platform,
then make sure to open a support ticket.

In addition to Sauce Labs, there's a growing number of companies that offer
appium as part of their commercial automation products.

Google actively develops Android. If you've found an issue with the Android
platform then [let them know](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list).
It's best to make sure that the bug is in Android itself instead of in appium
before opening an android issue.
