## Summary

We compiled the open source API Demos app from source. Then the Appium
Ruby Console was used find elements with the page command. After ending the
session, we looked at two visual tools. Appium.app is great for generating
gestures and uiautomatorviewer helps inspect elements on the page visually.

In the next chapter, we'll write our first test.
